Here are the potential datasets we could use: 
1. the amount of energy supply OR the unit price the residents have to pay→ we need a link for this dataset - Diane
measures of electricity supply: 1. regular ways of calculating 2. generator (a fixed price, a few hundreds)
https://www.iea.org/countries/lebanon <- reliable & consistent

2. divide the political parties into different categories
could use the line graph to show the data pattern of changes of energy usage across different years when the political parties change→ more research needs to be done!
But there is a key limitation: yearly population growth could be a confounding factor, also, we cannot really say/comment anything about the politics in Lebanon, so we can just delete this political perspective if our RQ decides to focus on “Ethnicity”, the distribution of ethnic groups, etc.

3. the population/percentage of a specific religious group in different cities of Lebanon 
using aggregated data, how concentrated the religious group is
how to relate this to the variable of electricity supply?

4. general demographic data could be useful: 
online web (not reliable) https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/lebanon-population/
Wikipedia page (not reliable) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Lebanon
Wikipedia page (not reliable) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Lebanon

5. this website has some good data, but not sure how to download them: https://www.livepopulation.com/country/lebanon.html

6. Good, downloadable world bank data from before 1985 - 2020 (migration trend, refugee population trend, gender trend, age dependency ration): https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.REFG.OR?end=2020&locations=LB&start=1982&view=chart could delete, not relevant to the RQ

7. Useful data but undownloadable source: Population growth trend 1996-2017 per administrative region in Lebanon: https://www.citypopulation.de/en/lebanon/admin/; this is also available for cities: https://www.citypopulation.de/en/lebanon/cities/ 
could delete, not relevant to the RQ

8. Lebanese government web page for statistics with a lots of downloadable data on households, economy, population (most reliable dataset): http://www.cas.gov.lb/index.php/about-lebanon-en
