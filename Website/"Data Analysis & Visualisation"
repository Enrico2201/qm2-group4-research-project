Inspired and guided by the lecture on Data Science Process from the course BASC0005 that we all had, we have adopted a typical methodology for this data science project. 
After the problem is clearly defined seen from above, the summary of all datasets was carried out in Python.

Methods of data analysis: 
1. to summarise and present a quick overview of all the datasets that we used, the descriptive summary statistics for all datasets used (i.e., the energy consumption per capita, real GDP per capita, HDI index) in the Table 1 below.
--> the values of mean, max, min, standard deviation (spread/variation)

2. plot the data distribution using Python

Methods of data visualisation:
1. line graph, linear regression (Pearson coefficients, R-squared values)
2. violin plot
3. cluserting graphs

Data analysis derived from the visualisations
"Seen from Figure 1, it ..."(analyse data further based on the visualisations we made)
