# Summary data analysis

After clearly defining the problem and collecting the data for variables of research interest, to have a quick overview of all the data that we will use, we computed the descriptive summary statistics for both Lebanon data and Jordan data on Excel. The results are presented in the two summary statistics tables below.

*Note*: Seen from the tables, if using Tukey fences as benchmarks, for the Lebanon data, there are two lower outliers in the data of total energy supply per capita and one lower outlier in the data of GNI per capita (the data values are from 1990 and 1992 - the years fairly close to the end of Lebanese civil war), while for the Jordan data, there are six higher outliers in the data of total energy supply per capita. 

Although these data values are lower or higher outliers (i.e. lower than the corresponding low outlier limits or higher than the corresponding high outlier limit), they should and will be included in the following analysis. There is no valid reason to remove them because they are true data points with real-world meanings constituting an important part of the data pattern.
