# Summary data analysis - Marie
After the problem is clearly defined, the summary of all datasets was carried out using Python.

To give a quick overview of all the data that we used, the summary statistics table (Table 1) is presented with descriptive summary statistics for all datasets used in our research.

1. in the “Summary data analysis” section, add another summary statistics table for Jordan data (we could give some space for complementary investigation here on this separate web page, otherwise it might be quite blank anyway) - Marie

After you finish this, could you please send me the excel file with two summary statistics tables? I’d like to adjust the table design. Thank you!

2. for the purpose of clustering, replace the histograms by box plots to show in a clearer way if the distribution of all variables is roughly symmetrical or not (so make five box plots for Lebanon, five box plots for Jordan) - Marie

please do this on Python and put the lines of code as a link at the bottom of this page, see how this sample did it https://jingxue19.wixsite.com/team9/methodology

3. give concise textual explanation to highlight the findings from the descriptive summary statistics and boxplots - Ling

-analysis of outliers: Seen from this table above, there is one lower outlier in the data on total energy supply per capita. The minimum value of 29.2 TJ (the data point in 1990 - just at the end of Lebanese civil war) is lower than 34.6 TJ, the lower bound of tukey fence. We think, however, it is a true data point that should and will be included in our data analysis and visualisation.
