# Summary data analysis - Marie
After the problem is clearly defined, the summary of all datasets was carried out using Python.

the big descriptive summary statistics table
to summarise and present a quick overview of all the datasets that we used, the descriptive summary statistics for all datasets used
the values of mean, max, min, standard deviation (spread/variation)

all histograms 
plot the data distribution using Python
 
# ANOVA & Regression (linear regression graphs + multiple regression graphs) - Ling
-line graph
--> analyse the Pearson coefficients, R-squared values etc., Kendall tau correlation coefficients - to show that there is a non-linear relationship between two variables

# Clusering - Lydia
As we have different units and distributions in the five variables, technical standardization will be applied across the datasets using the formula 𝑧 = (𝑥−𝜇 )/𝜎 (whether use Z-score standardization depends on whether all data points are roughly symmetrically distributed) in Excel, to obtain manipulated data on a comparable scale. 		
Perform clustering on all the variables by years & calculate Silhouette scores to assess the clustering quality, i.e. how strongly data is clustered→ The clustering results with the optimal number of clusters (highest silhouette scores) will be ultimately presented, summarized and analyzed.→ to identify different clusters of years→ analyse the electricity consumption/energy supply per capita & social wellbeing relationship in relation to turbulent events that repeatedly happened in certain clustered years
* present six clustering graphs

# Violinplots & Complementary investigation - Lydia (violinplots, clustering), Ling (regression)
Draw two grouped violinplots to visualise the same variable by different countries (input data points for Lebanon and Isarel across 29 years), to ascertain whether Isarel is a ‘similar’ country or not
https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/54-grouped-violinplot
x-axis: Year; y-axis: Total Energy Supply per capita
x-axis: Year; y-axis: Total Electricity generation  

repeat regression and clusering for the data on Isarel
