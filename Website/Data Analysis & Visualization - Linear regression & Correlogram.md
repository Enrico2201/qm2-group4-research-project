# Correlogram & Linear regression

As we have a multivariate dataset, a correlogram (or a correlation matrix) is used to analyse the relationship between each pair of numerical variables. It allows us to visualize the relationships of the whole dataset in a glimpse and to elegantly present them. Within the matrix, on each sub-scatterplot, linear regression is performed on the data. The diagonal also displays the distribution (evolution) of each variable over the past 30 years using a density plot.

Also, we calculated the regression statistics and correlation coefficients for subplot A-F on Python. The results are summarised in the table below.

## Linear regression analysis

analyse the Pearson correlation coefficients, Spearman's correlation coefficients, Kendall tau correlation coefficients (to explore if there is a significant relationship between the two variables) + p-values, R-squared values
+ Subplot D and Subplot E are the most relevant applications of linear regression analysis on the Lebanon's datasets
