Background & context

The current crisis in Lebanon is not the first since the end of the civil war in 1990. 
The political and economic situation has been unstable since then, with several crises (political corruption, currency collapse) affecting the country. 
However, the World Bank estimates that “Lebanon economic and financial crisis is likely to rank in the top 10, possibly top three, most severe crises episodes globally since the mid-nineteenth century.” 
Thus, the current situation in Lebanon, to which the 2019 explosion in the port of Beirut contributed, is particularly relevant to study as it is unparalleled. 
Moreover, the country is heavily dependent on imports and since the destruction of its main port, it has struggled to deliver energy. 
Power outages, which were not uncommon before, are becoming more frequent and threaten essential services to citizens. 
Hospitals have to put operations on hold out of fear of losing power while they perform them, and more generally the daily lives of the Lebanese are affected by these shortages. 
Recently, a power outage lasted more than 24 hours, paralysing the country. This unprecedented situation therefore raises the alarm not only about the economic situation of the country, but also about a humanitarian crisis. 
Power outages of this magnitude have a significant impact on the daily lives of the Lebanese and therefore on their social wellbeing. 
This is what we will try to prove through our research.
