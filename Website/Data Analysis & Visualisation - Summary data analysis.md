# Summary data analysis

After clearly defining the problem and collecting data for the variables of research interest, to have a quick overview of all the data that we will use, we computed the descriptive summary statistics for both Lebanon data and Jordan data on Python. (The low outlier limit and high outlier limit for Tukey fences are computed afterwards using the formula "lower quartile - 1.5 x interquartile range" and "upper quartile + 1.5 x interquartile range" respectively.) 

The results are presented in the two summary statistics tables below.
